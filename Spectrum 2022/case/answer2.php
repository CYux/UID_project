      Mary has provided John with opportunities to peek his interest in class. Do you think Mary should have ignored John's behaviour and think that he should learn by himself?      </p>
      </li>
      <article>
      The answer is that Mary should not assume that John would learn by himself. A teacher responsiblity is to help the distracted students and atleast try to boost their interest. So, It is correct way that Mary has helped John to peak his interest.

      <p>
      In the case of John, Do you think that Mary's strategy would work?
      </p>
      </li>
      <article>
      The answer is that explaining the topics to John in person would make him inclined towards the subject. This might lead to gain in his interest. And constantly conducting quizzes will also test his ability in the subject. So, Mary's strategy would work.

      <li>
      <p>
      What other strategy should Mary follow to involve John in class?
      </p>
      </li>
      <article>
      Making the student to discuss with his/her friends or giving extra assignments might work in specific cases. But, pointing the student in the middle of the class might lead to decrease in his/her confidence. So, in the case of John, Mary's strategy would work better.
