						<p>The teacher does not know how to handle the student who seems to have more experience in the subject. In science courses it is important for the teacher to take in consideration the answers that students provide. Allow them to participate and offer suggestions for discussion. In this case the teacher was not aware of Darren's knowledge. For this scenario I would like for pre service teachers or 1st year teachers to be aware of the various responses that the teacher could have made towards Darren's excitement and knowledge about simple machines and then be able to correctly handle the situation in the classroom which will help students be successful and the teacher confident and in control of the class. Note: Elementary teachers usually don’t have a science background. They rely on their basic science knowledge from college, their science method's courses, and science resources provided for them in order to engage students.</p>
