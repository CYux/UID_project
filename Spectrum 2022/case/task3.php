					<br/>

						<p>Maggie is an enthusiastic and highly motivated third grade teacher in an inner-city school and completing her first year. Her determination to make science personally meaningful for her third grade students spur her to commit considerable time and resources to setting up and using cooperative groups to carry out scientific investigations. The early success that she sees these groups achieve is later tempered by the knowledge that not all students in every group are benefiting from the shared experience. Maggie wonders how her decision, based on sound and professionally advocated classroom-based research, could have led to such undesirable and unexpected ends.
