					<br/>

						<p>Melissa is a teaching student and wants to provide her class with real world sciences examples and allow them to use their own thinking skills. Melissa wants to try a problem-solving lab with her tenth-grade biology class. During the lab she expected that her students would make an important connection between genetics concepts and the real world as they determined the genotypic and phenotypic ratio for Indian corn. Melissa was excited about the lab, but her students quickly became disengaged and off task. She was left trying to figure out what she did wrong.
