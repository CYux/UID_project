      What would you do differently with Melissa’s third – period class?
      </p>
      </li>
      <article>
      The right answer is: Have the lab at a later date so you can explain to the students how to use critical thinking to solve a problem.
      The students were frustrated in fist period because they were not accustomed to using critical thinking to solve problems in their classes. The students were used to having step by step instruction with the answer to the lab incorporated in the lab worksheet. The new way of thinking was unclear to them; they were not prepared to us a different way of thinking. As a teacher you should explain critical thinking and positive problem-solving altitude. Have the students use the tool that you taught them and have the lab at a later date.

      Do you agree with Melissa’s initial idea that high school biology students should have opportunities to solve real-world problems and apply concepts?

      The answer is that explaining the topics to John in person would make him inclined towards the subject. This might lead to gain in his interest. And constantly conducting quizzes will also test his ability in the subject. So, Mary's strategy would work.
