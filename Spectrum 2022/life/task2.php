						<p>Ms. Lily is a teacher to sixth grade students. There are four students in her class who have disruptive behaviour by acting out and seeking attention. One day while Ms. Lily was teaching the class, they were talking and cracking up at each other. To her surprise, one of the students started dancing in the class. Even after the lunch time, when the rest of the class had already left back to the classroom, they were still playing. After the class has started, they walked 15 minutes late into the classroom when the quiz review is going on. During the quiz review, Ms. Lily has decided to review the quiz in groups. After forming their group, the boys talked so loud and asked questions that had already been answered out loud. In addition, while the class is going on, one of the boys was constantly sneezing. After each sneeze one of the other boys would say "bless you" loud. The behaviour of these four boys was making other students pay more attention to them than they were to the teacher. This is the case of disruptive behaviour in the classroom.</p>
