						<p>At your school, teachers must rotate once every other week with playground duty, which involves being out on the playground during lunch time and helping to monitor the activities of students on the playground. One day on your shift right before the bell is to ring to end the lunch recess, a student from your class comes up and tells you that Jon (another student from your class) is standing over in the corner and has been throwing rocks, at both the building and in the general direction of other students. As you walk over to where Jon is you, you see he now has a big rock in his hand. You first ask Jon to put down the rock and he refuses to comply-stating "You can't make me.".</p>
