						<p>Sixth Period, the last period of the day is going on. Kim, a student in your class comes late and walks into your classroom. Kim is a student who is usually moody, but in general has not caused many problems although you have heard of being disrespectful to other teachers. Kim slams her books on to her desk. You can't help but think that first she comes late and then interrupts review of your class with slamming of books. You continue your lesson nd then you hear heavy sighs coming from kim and clearly an obscenity.</p>
